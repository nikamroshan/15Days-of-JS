# 🚀 15 Days of JavaScript Challenge

Welcome to my **15 Days of JavaScript Challenge**! 🎯  
This is a personal learning journey where I am dedicating 15 days to **refresh, rebuild, and reinforce** my JavaScript skills by working on small tasks and projects every day.

## 🧠 Why this challenge?

I’ve studied JavaScript before, but now I want to **restart with clarity**—this time by focusing on fundamentals, solving problems hands-on, and building useful mini-projects. Each day, I’ll create a new task, mini app, or concept-based code snippet to sharpen my understanding and consistency.

## 📅 What to expect?

- 🔁 15 days of continuous coding
- 📂 Each day in its own folder
- 🧱 Simple to intermediate-level JS projects
- 💡 Focus on fundamentals 
## ✅ Goal

By the end of this challenge, I aim to:
- Rebuild confidence in core JavaScript
- Strengthen problem-solving with JS
- Get comfortable with DOM and real-time interactivity
- Build a habit of daily coding

Stay tuned and feel free to fork, suggest improvements, or follow along with your own 15-day journey!
